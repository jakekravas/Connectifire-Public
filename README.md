Once you've successfully registered your account, you'll be prompted to create your profile, which will consist of a name, username, profile photo, and cover photo. These can be edited at any time. Once your profile is created, you can start writing posts, deleting posts, viewing posts, liking posts, and following others. You'll also have the option to delete your own posts, view all posts that you've liked, and unlike posts at any time. Your own personlized feed will be available to you and will consist of posts written by people you follow.
